# 🌍 UniVerSee  

**UniVerSee** is here to solve a major problem for students in Georgia—choosing the right university and career path. Many students struggle to find reliable information about faculties, programs, subjects, and study materials. Access to competent student consultations is limited, and for those living in the regions, attending open days can be difficult.  

By collaborating with Georgian universities, **UniVerSee** ensures equal opportunities for everyone. We provide insights into various professions and academic paths so that students can make informed decisions and confidently prepare for their **bachelor's and master's degrees**.
